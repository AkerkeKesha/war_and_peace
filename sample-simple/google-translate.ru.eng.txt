- Well, my prince.
Genoa and Lucca are no more than appanages, estates of the Buonaparte family.
No, I warn you, that if you do not tell me, that we have war, if you still allow yourselves to palliate all the infamies, all the atrocities of this Antichrist (my word, I believe it) - I do not know more, you are no longer my friend, you are no longer my faithful slave, as you say.
Well, hello, hello.
I see that I scare you, sit down and talk.
This is what the famous Anna Pavlovna Sherer, a lady-in-waiting and close associate of Empress Maria Feodorovna, spoke in July 1805, when meeting the important and official Prince Vasily, who was the first to come to her evening.
Anna Pavlovna coughed for several days, she had the flu, as she said (flu was then a new word, used only rarely).
In the notes sent out in the morning with the red footman, it was written without distinction in all: â€œIf you have nothing better to do, M. le comte (or my prince), and if the prospect of spending the evening with a poor patient does not frighten you too much, I will be delighted to see you at my place between 7 and 10 hours.
Annette Scherer ".
- God, what a virulent exit!
- answered, not in the least embarrassed by such a meeting, the prince entered, in a court, embroidered uniform, in stockings, shoes, and stars, with a bright expression of a flat face.
